Mentors4EDU recently hit 100k students on Udemy (and we teach more than that many students if you consider other platforms). To celebrate, we are currently considering starting a badge program through [BitBadges](https://bitbadges.web.app), once it garnishes more traction (not investment advice). It took us nearly seven years to hit this incredible learning milestone!
